# IsoAmb Rescue
IsoAmb Rescue is a arcade-style mini game developed by me (Martín Vázquez) for the GameDev.tv May's Game Jam.

The objective is simple: Make as many points while you protect an ambulance from its enemies using the power of your mouse to destroy them. Click on the enemies to destroy them and fill your slowMo bar to slow time and get more points!

You just have to watch the ambulance get to the safe building without a scratch. They will keep coming so stay alert!

Challenge yourself getting better and earn a huge amount of points.

Controls:

Mouse Left Click: Point at the enemy vehicule, click to destroy it
Mourse Right Click: Activate SlowMo powerup (when available)
Esc Key: Pause Menu
